#Handin-1

###First 

1. First step was to follow up the failing test to the root assert of JUnit.

2. Thus, for this test (20), I followed the test up to the check method, which in turn called the finalCheck method.

3. This finalCheck method performed an assertEquals on two strings. By printing the expected vs return values for this assertEquals,
I was able to determine the correct expected output for the test, thus fixing the error. 

###More Elegant

Steps 1 & 2 Stay As Is

Instead of printing the expected vs return values for the assertEquals, we can simply change our build.xml.
If we replace haltonfailure = "yes" with haltonfailure = "no", we ask junit to dump all tests into an html file in ./bin/junit
We then look through these html files to see the following line:

expected:<[1*v+-1<0]> but was:<[1*v+-1<=0]>

Thus, it is evident that our expected paramteter for our test is incorrect.
